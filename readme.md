# Crowd-Sourced Disaster Managment Tool
## Introduction

The tool lets users register, log in, and submit real-time disaster reports with location, type, and descriptions. It uses geolocation APIs for precise location capture. The admin dashboard features an interactive map and scrollable table for data management. A messaging system enables communication between users and responders. Built on Flask and SQLite, it ensures reliable data storage and management.
The crowdsourced disaster reporting tool enables users to submit real-time reports from disaster locations, providing emergency services with accurate, up-to-date information. An interactive map and scrollable reports improve disaster management and coordination. The messaging system facilitates direct communication between reporters and responders, enhancing response times. Geolocation ensures accurate data for better decision-making. Overall, the tool strengthens disaster response efforts through efficient reporting and communication.
This project innovates with real-time geolocation for precise disaster reporting and a dynamic admin dashboard featuring an interactive map for instant report management. Its integrated messaging system enhances direct communication between users and responders. Leveraging Flask and SQLite, the tool ensures robust, scalable backend performance and seamless data handling. This blend of real-time functionality and interactive design sets it apart as a cutting-edge solution.
